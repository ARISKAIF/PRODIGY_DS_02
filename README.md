# PRODIGY_DS_02
# 🚀 Task-02: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Prodigy InfoTech Internship
📌 Objective
This project is part of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship. The task focuses on performing Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of choice. The goal is to understand the data, clean and preprocess it, explore relationships between features, and identify patterns, trends, or insights.

📂 Task Description
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

🗂️ Dataset Used
Dataset Source: Prodigy InfoTech - Task 2 Dataset
Type: Titanic dataset (CSV format)
Features: Passenger details like age, class, sex, survival status, fare, etc.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: Histograms, bar plots for columns like age, sex, fare
Bivariate Analysis: Survival rate based on gender, class, fare, age
Correlation Heatmap: To show relationships between numeric variables
Insights/Observations:
Females had a higher survival rate than males
Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive
Young children also had better chances of survival

📈 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

✅ Results & Conclusion
The analysis helped identify key factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic. Visualizations made it easier to understand relationships between features and supported meaningful conclusions.
